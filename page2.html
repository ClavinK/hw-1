        <h5>A Short Explanation of my Hobbies</h5>
        <dl>
            <dt>Gaming</dt>
            <dd>- Some of my favorite games are single player open world RPG's including Elden Ring, Final Fantasy 7, Skyrim, Red Dead Redepemtion 2 and more. <br> My passion for video games came from my oldest cousin who showed me his games when I was really young so we both share the same hobby to this day.</dd>
            <dt>Swimming</dt>
            <dd>- Swimming is my favorite form of cardio and is just overall a fun thing to do especially in the summer. <br>I may not be the greatest swimmer, but when the opportunity arises I will swim laps in a pool or go as far as I can possibly go in the ocean and swim.</dd>
            <dt>Cooking</dt>
            <dd>- Cooking was actually something I was considering doing as a career before I made a final decision on pursuing Computer Science. <br> Watching my mom cook as well as other famous chefs like Gordon Ramsay were my inspirations to learn more about cooking.</dd>
            <dt>Cosplay</dt>
            <dd>- Only recently I started doing cosplays for Conventions. It is such a cool experience but also very expensive. <br> The idea of dressing up as your favorite character from any media is such an interesting experience. I plan to do more cosplays and attend more conventions in the future.</dd>
            <dt>Hiking</dt>
            <dd>- Hiking for me is such a relaxing experience, it lets me clear my head and enjoy the scenery if there is any. <br>It definitely is one of my go to methods of relieving stress after school or work.</dd>
